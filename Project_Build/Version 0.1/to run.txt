To start the Java program:
	Navigate to the 4F00_MOPP folder
	Run:
		java -cp ./bin SystemStarter

	***Yes you should be able to do java -cp ./4F00_MOPP/bin SystemStarter instead, but it doesnt work.
	Basically, to get it to work we need to change the ParentDirecty variable in the file to extend to public_html. 
	Which would cause it to not work on my computer at home. If you need an explanation ask me in person, its easier to show than explain.
